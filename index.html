         <h1>Tofu: A Journey of DISCOVERY!!!</h1>
            <p>Tofu is a weird food. It comes in a solid, soft, pale brick that is dripping with liquid. Maybe not the best look for one of THE BEST FOODS OUT THERE??? Thats right. I am going to show you three delicious ways I have found to turn that soggy old brick into GOLD.</p>

               <p>The classic quesadilla except for one little thing...It has tofu in it! This recipe starts out like any other quesadilla. You grab your tortillas and throw some cheese at them. However, this time you also coat some cubed tofu in special spices and throw those puppies at it too. After all is said and done you bake it and enjoy with some salso or hot sauce!</p>

               <p>An American Chinese food staple! But guess what?? TOFU TIME AHAAA! This one is pretty self explanatory. Instead of frying up some chicken we are instead going to rip off chunks of tofu and coat them in corn starch. After frying them to a crisp you top them with some homeade General Tsos Sauce and voila, you have the great flavors of childhood take out nights minus the chickens and minus the awkward family relationships.</p>

               <p>Finally, lets take a trip to Japan with this golden, savory Japanese style curry. We have potatoes, carrots and onions all chillin out and maxin all cool in a ski resort hot tub aka pot of boiling water. But wait...who just joined the party...oh wow its the ultra popular, very cool, academic over-achiever Tofu!! Everyone is celebrating and having a great time. Finally we put some curry blocks in that tub and dig in!</p>
